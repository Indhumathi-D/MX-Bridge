The purpose of this MX Alumni portal is to create a social networking website between alumni and current year students to gather and share information. This system is an online application that can be accessed from anywhere with proper login provided, which will give better service to the alumni/students. The final product will be a website that acts as an exclusive social network between alumni and students and viewable in public. In order to interact on the website, the user must be a member and signed in. This portal will be helpful for the MX Alumni association. Alumni association is a group of graduates of former students. This project will manage alumni data of college. The main advantage of this project is it will connect old students and new students of the college. Old students can view current activities of their alumni and alumni can view activities related to their department.
